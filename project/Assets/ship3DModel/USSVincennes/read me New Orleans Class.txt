Readme- New Orleans-class Heavy cruiser

OK, this is a hobby, so the model I've made isn't perfect. Understanding, that I hope you get some enjoyment from it. 

I made this lo-res model to help fill out fleet scenes since superb models of carriers, battleships and destroyers are available- but not every campaign had a dozen battleships prowling around.

The zipped package includes...
1. simple model in obj format
2. mapped materials with textures (CA44 USS Vincennes) for hull and superstructure.

Please, personal, non commercial use only.
