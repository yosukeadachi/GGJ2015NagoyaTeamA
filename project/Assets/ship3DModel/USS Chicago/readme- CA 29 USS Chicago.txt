Readme- CA 29 USS Chicago

OK, this is a hobby, so the model I've made isn't perfect. Understanding that, I hope you get some enjoyment from it. 

Note: I borrowed some parts of my Vincennes Shade file to make this model 

The zipped package includes...

-simple textured OBJ model of this US Navy Northhampton-class heavy cruiser. It has an .mtl file, so imports with the textures into Bryce etc. Shaders are used for glass and the superstructure. Each turret and its cannons are discreet materials so they can be readily manipulated in packages that allow geometry to be split according to material zone.
-Poser Runtime folder (libraries, geometries and textures) to load the same obj into Poser. 
-map to make your own textures
